# Contributing

[Fork and clone the repository][fork] by going to
https://github.com/pymanopt/pymanopt/fork, and cloning the repository with

    $ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/pymanopt.git

Set up a local development environment, installing both the runtime and
development dependencies by running

    $ pip install -e ".[all]"

Verify that all existing tests pass by executing the test suite via
[nose2][nose2]:

    $ nose2 tests

Note that we run the [flake8][flake8] utility on every python file in the
package to verify coding style consistency during our integration tests.
As such, failure to comply to the [style guide][style] will result in a failing
ci build.
To prevent adding commits which fail to adhere to the PEP8
guidelines, we include a [pre-commit][pre-commit] config, which immediately
invokes flake8 on all files staged for commit when running `git commit`.
To enable the hook, simply run `pre-commit install` after installing
`pre-commit` either manually via `pip` or as part of `dev` variant, e.g.

    $ pip install -e ".[dev]"

Push a feature branch to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].
Refer to [this guide][commits] on how to write good commit messages.

## Sign-off

By making a contribution (pull requesting or committing) to the Pymanopt
project you certify that

* you have the right to submit it to Pymanopt.

* you created the contribution/modification; or you based it on previous work
  that, to the best of your knowledge, is covered by a compatible open source
  license; or someone who did one of the former provided you with this
  contribution/modification and you are submitting it without changes.

* you understand and agree that your contribution/modification to this
  project is public and that a record of it (including all information you
  submit with it, including copyright notices and your sign-off) is
  maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with Pymanopt's
  3-clause BSD license or the open source license(s) involved.

To make your certification explicit we borrow the "sign-off" procedure
from the Linux kernel project, i.e., each commit message should contain
a line saying

    Signed-off-by: Name Surname <name.surname@example.org>

using your real name and email address.
Running the git-commit command with the -s option automatically adds this line.
