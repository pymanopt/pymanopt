            # Heuristic -- added Dec. 2, 2013 (NB) to replace the former
            # heuristic. This heuristic is documented in the book by Conn Gould
            # and Toint on trust-region methods, section 17.4.2. rhonum
            # measures the difference between two numbers. Close to
            # convergence, these two numbers are very close to each other, so
            # that computing their difference is numerically challenging: there
            # may be a significant loss in accuracy. Since the acceptance or
            # rejection of the step is conditioned on the ratio between rhonum
            # and rhoden, large errors in rhonum result in a very large error
            # in rho, hence in erratic acceptance / rejection. Meanwhile, close
            # to convergence, steps are usually trustworthy and we should
            # transition to a Newton- like method, with rho=1 consistently. The
            # heuristic thus shifts both rhonum and rhoden by a small amount
            # such that far from convergence, the shift is irrelevant and close
            # to convergence, the ratio rho goes to 1, effectively promoting
            # acceptance of the step.  The rationale is that close to
            # convergence, both rhonum and rhoden are quadratic in the distance
            # between x and x_prop. Thus, when this distance is on the order of
            # sqrt(eps), the value of rhonum and rhoden is on the order of eps,
            # which is indistinguishable from the numerical error, resulting in
            # badly estimated rho's.
            # For abs(fx) < 1, this heuristic is invariant under offsets of f
            # but not under scaling of f. For abs(fx) > 1, the opposite holds.
            # This should not alarm us, as this heuristic only triggers at the
            # very last iterations if very fine convergence is demanded.

            # the Hessian (approximation) and if we had infinite numerical
            # precision.  In practice, nonlinear approximations of the Hessian
            # such as the built-in finite difference approximation and finite
            # numerical accuracy can cause the model to increase. In such
            # scenarios, we decide to force a rejection of the step and a
            # reduction of the trust-region radius. We test the sign of the
            # regularized rhoden since the regularization is supposed to
            # capture the accuracy to which rhoden is computed: if rhoden were
            # negative before regularization but not after, that should not be
            # (and is not) detected as a failure.
