        Perform optimization using gradient descent with linesearch.
        This method first computes the gradient (derivative) of obj
        w.r.t. arg, and then optimizes by moving in the direction of
        steepest descent (which is the opposite direction to the gradient).
        Arguments:
            - problem
                Pymanopt problem setup using the Problem class, this must
                have a .manifold attribute specifying the manifold to optimize
                over, as well as a cost and enough information to compute
                the gradient of that cost.
            - x=None
                Optional parameter. Starting point on the manifold. If none
                then a starting point will be randomly generated.
        Returns:
            - x
                Local minimum of obj, or if algorithm terminated before
                convergence x will be the point at which it terminated.
